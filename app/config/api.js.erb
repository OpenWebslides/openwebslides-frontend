/**
 * api.js.erb - Runtime API configuration
 *
 * The compiled JavaScript bundle uses a hardcoded default API base URL. However, in production environments
 * this variable has to be overridden with the correct API base URL on runtime. This is achieved in the Docker
 * environment by rendering this file into a publicly served location, and including it in the `index.html`.
 *
 * This file has no use in development environments. Changing the location of this file necessitates changing
 * the `docker-entrypoint.sh` file in the backend code.
